        <img src="Ehsan4.jpg" alt="Ehsan Shahri">
        <p>I am a researcher at the <a href="https://www.ua.pt/" target="_blank">University of Aveiro</a>. In my research, I focus on developing efficient real-time architectures within the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) domain, specifically addressing challenges related to timeliness and safety guarantees. Currently, I am actively exploring applications of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) technologies. Simultaneously, I am investigating the potential combination of these technologies with relevant communication protocols, such as MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport). The goal is to build dynamically reconfigurable systems, potentially incorporating composability and dynamic Quality of Service (QoS) management..</p>
